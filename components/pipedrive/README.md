# Overview

The Pipedrive API is a powerful source of data that allows developers to build
custom applications and integrations that can "plug-and-play" into the back-end
of Pipedrive. With a few lines of code, developers can create amazing ways to
use Pipedrive's data for productivity and success. Here are a few examples of
what can be done with the Pipedrive API:

- Automate the addition of leads into the back-end of Pipedrive from other
  sources such as Salesforce, or other 3rd party applications.
- Customize new views and filters for managing deals and activities.
- Integrate with other platforms to build custom reports and insights.
- Develop custom modules such as invoice generation and payment processing.
- Create custom tasks, reminders, and notifications that sync with other tools
  and platforms.
- Automate the creation of tasks and activities based on arbitrary criteria.
- Monitor and track changes that happen within Pipedrive with webhooks.
- Create dynamic logic-driven processes with automated decision making.
- Create custom dashboards and data visualizations to get an overview of the
  business performance.
- Automatically export data to other cloud-based services such as Google Drive,
  Dropbox, or other cloud-based applications.
